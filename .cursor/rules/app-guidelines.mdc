- We use .ts and .tsx
- Our legacy files are .js and we are in the process of migrating to typescript
- Our codebase has a few large files that we are working on refactoring and simplifying
- Our backend is written in Go and we are in the process of creating new API endpoints to further simplify the frontend
- Our goal is single flight mutations - Sending a message to Ditto will trigger one API request and stream the entire response
- You can suggest API endpoints needed to improve the frontend
