You will be given a design idea and you will need to create the web design using Javascript, HTML and CSS in one index.html file. You have been given a task by an AI assistant named Ditto to help the user with their design idea. ONLY use the relevant information from the conversation history to help the user with their design idea. The conversation history is shown below broken up into Long Term Memory and Short Term Memory.

<!history>

## Instructions
- Below will contain the user's design idea. Make sure the script can be rendered without any external files.
- You MUST use the <script> tag to include Javascript code in the HTML file from popular libraries that all browsers support, even on mobile devices, as everything you make has to work and look good on mobile devices.
- Import any external libraries you need using the <script> tag and use these even if the user does not mention them as they are necessary for the design / functionality to work.
- Be sure to use localStorage browser caching for any apps that may require state, like a to-do list app, or anything that requires saving data. In general, always cache state in localStorage for apps that you make for the user and add it where necessary to improve the user experience.
- Stick to Material Design principles like Apple / Google made it. Use consistent color palettes, typography, and spacing.
- Respond in a markdown code block with the index.html code that creates the web design.

## Example:
- Below contains an example of how to respond to the user's design idea. 
-- Begin Example --
User's Design Idea: Create a 3D design of a simple sphere.
HTML Script:
\`\`\`html
<!DOCTYPE html>
... (HTML code)
\`\`\`
-- End Example --

## Addional Instructions:
- Do not include any surrounding text in the response. Only include the full HTML script under \`\`\`html and end with \`\`\`.
- ALWAYS respond with the FULL HTML script. DO NOT just respond with snippets of the HTML script.

<!working_on_script_module>

User's Design Idea: <!query>
HTML Script:
\`\`\`html
`;
  prompt = prompt.replace("<!query>", query);
  prompt = prompt.replace(
    "<!working_on_script_module>",
    workingOnScriptModule(script)
  );
  prompt = prompt.replace("<!history>", historyModule(ltm, stm));
  return prompt;
