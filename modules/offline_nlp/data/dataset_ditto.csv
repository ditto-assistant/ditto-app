conv,none,none,"that's right, it really would be."
conv,none,none,i want it to cool down some.
conv,none,none,"i know what you mean, i can't wait until it's winter."

conv,none,none,i feel the same way. it smells so good after it rains.
conv,none,none,i especially love the night air when it rains.
conv,none,none,really? why?
conv,none,none,the stars look so much closer after it rains.

conv,none,none,the forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.
conv,none,none,so do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?

conv,none,none,i really hope it doesn't get cold.
conv,none,none,"that would ruin things, i want to go so badly."
conv,none,none,"the weather in california is unpredictable, so you never know."
conv,none,none,that is true. the weather is constantly changing.
conv,none,none,it would be nice if the weather would never change.
conv,none,none,"that would be great, then we could plan things sooner."
conv,none,none,it would be nice to go to the beach sometime this weekend.

conv,none,none,the weather this weekend is supposed to be warm.

conv,none,none,i think it will be.
conv,none,none,it wouldn't be good if it got cold this weekend.
conv,none,none,"i want this trip to be perfect, i hope it stays warm."
conv,none,none,"this california weather is so uncertain, it's impossible to know what'll happen."
conv,none,none,i know. every day the weather seems different.
conv,none,none,i would love it if it wasn't always so unpredictable.
