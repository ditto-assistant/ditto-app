This repository is dual-licensed under:

1. Apache License 2.0 (for Individual and Small Business Use)

2. Commercial License (for Large Organizations)

Revenue Determination
- "Annual revenue" is defined as the total gross revenue of the legal entity using the software during the most recent completed fiscal year
- For subsidiaries that are majority-owned by a parent company, the relevant revenue is that of the subsidiary, not the parent company, provided the subsidiary operates independently with separate management, finances, and operations
- For complex corporate structures, revenue is determined at the level of the legal entity directly using or benefiting from the software
- Revenue verification may be requested annually by Omni Aura LLC, requiring certification by an officer of the company or documentation such as tax filings or audited financial statements
- Organizations must comply with verification requests within 30 days or risk license termination

License Transition
- Organizations that cross the $1M USD annual revenue threshold have a 90-day grace period from the end of the fiscal year to obtain a commercial license
- During this transition period, the Apache License 2.0 continues to apply
- No retroactive fees will be charged for use during the period when the organization qualified for the Apache License
- Organizations that temporarily exceed the threshold but fall below it in subsequent years may revert to the Apache License after providing verification of current revenue

Special Cases
- Non-profit organizations, educational institutions, and open-source projects may qualify for special licensing terms regardless of revenue size by contacting peyton@omniaura.co
- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or hosted service providers using this software must obtain a commercial license if their revenue exceeds $1M USD, even if the software is not directly distributed
- Free and open source projects may apply for an exemption from commercial licensing requirements

Derivative Works
- Derivative works created by Apache License 2.0 users must be distributed under the same dual license terms
- Commercial licensees receive additional rights regarding distribution of derivative works as specified in their commercial license agreement
- Contributions to the main repository are subject to the project's Contributor License Agreement (MIT-0 / MIT No Attribution)

Usage Terms
- Individual developers and small businesses (revenue < $1M USD annually) may freely use this software under Apache 2.0
- Organizations exceeding $1M USD in annual revenue must obtain a commercial license
- All users must maintain and display copyright and license notices
- Usage of the Omni Aura name and logos requires explicit permission

Enforcement and Compliance
- Failure to obtain a required commercial license constitutes copyright infringement
- Users found in violation may be liable for license fees, statutory damages, and legal costs

    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

4.  Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
    Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
    that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
    attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
    the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
    distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
    include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
    within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
    pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
    of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
    as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
    within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
    wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
    of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
    do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
    notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
    or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
    that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
    as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

5.  Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6.  Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7.  Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8.  Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9.  Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
