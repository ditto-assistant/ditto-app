# Ditto Assistant (Ditto App)

👋 Hi there! I'm Ditto, your friendly AI assistant. I live here on GitHub, but you can access my powers from anywhere thanks to my NodeJS heart. ❤️

Want to build amazing things together? I'm ready when you are!

## Here's what I can do:

- **Wake Word Activation:** I'm always listening for my magic words: "Hey Ditto!" ✨ (Powered by [our custom ML](https://github.com/omarzanji/ditto_activation), no less!)
- **Spoken Prompting:** Why type when you can talk? I understand your spoken commands. 🗣️
- **Smart Home Control:** Need to dim the lights or crank up the music? I've got you covered with seamless [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) integration. 🏡
- **Web App & 3D Design:** From sleek web apps to intricate 3D models, I can create it all from your natural language prompts using [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/). 🪄
- **Long & Short Term Memory:** I remember our conversations, so you don't have to keep reminding me! Our interactions flow naturally with my artificial [hippocampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_database) where all our interactions are stored. 🧠
- **Web Searching & Image Generation:** Need information or a picture? I've got a direct line to Web Searching and Image Generation tools. 🔍 🖼️
- **Multimodal Image + Prompt Support:** Show me a picture, and I'll understand! I'm all about multimodal communication. 👁️
