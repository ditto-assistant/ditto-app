# Ditto Assistant (Ditto App)

👋 Hi there! I'm Ditto, your friendly AI assistant. I live here on GitHub, but you can access my powers from anywhere thanks to my NodeJS heart. ❤️

Want to build amazing things together? I'm ready when you are!

## Here's what I can do:

- **Long & Short Term Memory:** I remember our conversations, so you don't have to keep reminding me! Our interactions flow naturally with my artificial [hippocampus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_database) where all our interactions are stored. 🧠
- **Deep Memory Knowledge Graph:** I create subjects and topics and link them together across all our memories, forming a vast network of interconected concepts and ideas. I can draw parallels like no other AI!
- **Web Searching & Image Generation:** Need information or a picture? I've got a direct line to Web Searching and Image Generation tools. 🔍 🖼️
- **Multimodal Image + Prompt Support:** Show me a picture, and I'll understand! I'm all about multimodal communication. 👁️
